# Attendance Taker 
A python script which takes names of students present in class and provide their attendance.
Currently it contains hard-coded list of students of CSA IET-DAVV 4th year.
So, it can take attedance of only these fellas as of now.

The idea is that while taking any online class on any platform esp. Google meet, there are extensions which help to generate a list of names of students present in class. But at the end teacher needs to make the entries in a spreadsheet. This process becomes redundant and cumbersome. 

This app will take the names of student present in class and provide attendance on form of 'P's roll no. wise:
``` 
P

P
P
P

P

P
```
Only task remaining is to copy this and paste it in the spreadsheet.
